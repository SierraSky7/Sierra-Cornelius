Celebrating and Sustaining the HumanitiesIt could be said that the western meadowlark, Montana’s state bird, inspires self-discovery, much like the humanities do. Its commanding and rich flute-like melody persuades us to pause and reflect inwardly on our personal journey. Both the humanities and the western meadowlark encourage us to explore our inner world and to sing out and celebrate our discoveries.
